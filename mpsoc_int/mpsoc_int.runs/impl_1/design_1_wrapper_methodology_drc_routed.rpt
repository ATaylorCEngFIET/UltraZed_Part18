2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDCE cell dbg_hub/inst/CORE_XSDB.UUT_MASTER/U_ICON_INTERFACE/U_CMD5/shift_reg_in_reg[2] in site SLICE_X43Y35 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDCE cell dbg_hub/inst/CORE_XSDB.UUT_MASTER/U_ICON_INTERFACE/U_CMD5/shift_reg_in_reg[1] is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-35#1 Warning
No common node in paths with the same clock  
The clock dbg_hub/inst/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_inst/SERIES7_BSCAN.bscan_inst/INTERNAL_TCK has paths without common node
Related violations: <none>
